# About

The IRS has started to systematically release administrative data and meta-data related to charitable organizations. As a result individuals can now access a tremendous amount of information on a charity before donating or supporting the entity, and policy-makers have a much bigger picture on the role that these 1.5 million organizations play in the economy and society. 

The data, however, is complex. And documentation is often sparse. 

This site was created for two primary purposes: 

**(1) To document the location of IRS 990 open data assets.**  

**(2) To organize and archive discussions around data quality, documentation, and meta-data that makes the open data useful.**

## Background on IRS 990 Forms

US-based tax-exempt organizations** are required to disclose basic financial information and organizational activities via IRS 990 forms. 

Charities are thus bound by a social contract - they receive favorable tax status and are eligible to receive tax-exempt donations but in return they must be transparent in how funds are used and accountable to supporters and charity watchdog organizations. 

The IRS serves as the data aggregator, but does not monitor or regulate charities directly. Abuses are typically reported and investigated at the state level through a branch of the Attorney General's office ([for example](https://oag.ca.gov/charities/complaints)). 

*Some organizations like churches are tax-exempt but do not have to file 990's, and others receive tax-deductible charitable contributions but are not tax-exempt. See [notes on IRS 990 filing scope](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/contributors/other-eligible-donees).*

## Potential Issues 

Common data issues include: 

* Inadequate documentation 
* Inadequate meta-data  
* Missing files, filings, or variables  
* Changes in variable definitions   
* Harmonization of data over time  
* Harmonization of a sample across forms  

The IRS typically lacks contact information to answer questions related to administrative data that has been released to the public, so it can be challenging to find answers to these types of questions. 

This forum is a place for experts and noeophytes to compare notes, share information, and contribute resources that help improve the quality and accessibility of the data.

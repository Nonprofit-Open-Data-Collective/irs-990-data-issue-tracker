## IRS 990 Data

Although **US-based tax-exempt organizations** are NOT required to pay federal taxes on generated revenues, they are required to disclose basic financial information and organizational activities via IRS 990 forms. 

Charities are thus bound by a social contract - they receive favorable tax status and are eligible to benefit from tax-exempt donations but in return they must be transparent in how funds are used and accountable to supporters and charity watchdog organizations. The IRS serves as the data aggregator, and abuses are typically investigated at the state level the charity branch of the Attorney General's office ([example](https://oag.ca.gov/charities/complaints)). 

*Some organizations like churches are tax-exempt but do not have to file 990's, and others receive tax-deductible charitable contributions but are not tax-exempt. See [notes on IRS 990 filing scope](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/contributors/other-eligible-donees).*

## Open Data 

The IRS has started to systematically release administrative data and meta-data related to charitable organizations. As a result individuals can now access a tremendous amount of information on a charity before donating or supporting the entity, and policy-makers have a much bigger picture on the role that these 1.5 million organizations play in the economy and society. 

The data, however, is complex. And documentation is often sparse. 

This site was created for two primary purposes: 

(1) To document the location of IRS 990 open data assets.  
(2) To organize and archive discussions around data quality, documentation, and meta-data that makes the open data useful.

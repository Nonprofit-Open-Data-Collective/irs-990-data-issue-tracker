The IRS has started to systematically release administrative data and meta-data related to over 1.5 million charitable organizations. The data, however, is complex. And documentation is often sparse. 

This site was created to **centalize discussions around data documentation, meta-data, and quality control issue** in order to avoid duplication of efforts and make the open data more useful.   

*The forum is **NOT intended for questions about analyzing data**, unless they are related to things like documentation, meta-data, or systematic errors discovered in public datasets.*

## IRS Nonprofit Data

Data assets that are within the scope of this forum include:

  - [990 Paper Filers](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/copies-of-eo-returns-available): returns submitted to the IRS in paper form, typically archived as PDFs. 
  - [990 E-Filers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-makes-electronically-filed-form-990-data-available-in-new-format): downloads of all electronic 990 filers starting in 2010.

## Potential Issues 

Common data issues include: 

* Inadequate documentation 
* Inadequate meta-data  
* Missing files, filings, or variables  
* Changes in variable definitions   
* Harmonization of data over time  
* Harmonization of a sample across forms  

The IRS typically lacks contact information to answer questions related to administrative data that has been released to the public, so it can be challenging to find answers to these types of questions. 

This forum is a place for experts and noeophytes to compare notes, share information, and contribute resources that help improve the quality and accessibility of the data.

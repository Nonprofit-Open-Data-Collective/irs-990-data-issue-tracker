## Background on IRS 990 Forms

US-based tax-exempt organizations are required to disclose basic financial information and organizational activities via IRS 990 forms. 

Charities are thus bound by a social contract - they receive favorable tax status and are eligible to receive tax-exempt donations but in return they must be transparent in how funds are used and accountable to supporters and charity watchdog organizations. 

The IRS serves as the data aggregator, but does not monitor or regulate charities directly. Abuses are typically reported and investigated at the state level through a branch of the Attorney General's office ([for example](https://oag.ca.gov/charities/complaints)). 

*Some organizations like churches are tax-exempt but do not have to file 990's, and others receive tax-deductible charitable contributions but are not tax-exempt. See [notes on IRS 990 filing scope](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/contributors/other-eligible-donees).*
